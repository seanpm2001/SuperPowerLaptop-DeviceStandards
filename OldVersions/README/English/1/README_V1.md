as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

# SuperPower-Laptops-DeviceStandards
A page for customizing an order for a super power-laptop (power laptop for power users) manufacturer and orders not yet available.

***

## About

See above. This project is for a brand of laptops that is designed to be very powerful, but also not too heavy (between 10 and 50 pounds) it also will be a laptop that you fully own, and won't be tied to a service. There are many options for customization, and you can have any Linux or BSD distribution you want that is compatible to be installed by default.

Some major pros include:

* 1 week (at 100% CPU usage and 100% brightness) to ~28.5 month (2 years, 4 months, 15 days) battery life (at less than 1% CPU usage, and 10% brightness)

> Con: the battery is expected to cost a minimum of $950 to the cost and will weigh at least 10 pounds, but it won't need to be charged as often, and likely won't require replacement unless your device can last over 40 years with heavy usage

* Over 10 petabytes of storage

* Over 1 terabyte of RAM

* No dongles, a wide array of USB ports are included that don't require the use of a dongle

* Mechanical keyboard, not a plastic one that can break in less than a year. Very precise and very durable to even the most powerful of power users

* 64x128 processor (support for 64 bit and 128 bit instructions)

* Screen resolution of 1080p (budget) to 17K/30K (30,720px17,280p) (high-end)

* Linux and BSD support is guaranteed, and due to durability, warranties are cheaper, and can range from 4 years ($200) to 20 years ($1000) warranties can be renewed for up to double the time after the original warranty expired (a 4 year warranty can be renewed at most 4 years later) warranties can only be renewed thrice (3 times) maximum

The con of this is:

* Very expensive: I currently am trying to produce a model of this laptop that costs less than $10000

* Very heavy: if you want a laptop similar to the latest MacBook lighter than air, this laptop is not for you. This laptop weighs between 20 and 50 pounds (50 pounds is the limit, as the first laptop and the most heavy one weighed this much, and I didn't want to go any higher due to how uncomfortable it would get)

## Customize your laptop

[Go here to customize your device to the settings you want](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SuperPower-Laptops-Customize/blob/main/Customize/SuperPowerLaptopCustomize.html)

***

## Production

These laptops are not yet being produced. I do not have the funding to create the first one. I need to raise at least $150,000 before I can produce the first 5 laptops, then I can start mass production at an exponential rate (0 -> 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 40 -> 80 -> 160 -> 320 -> 640 -> 1280 -> 2560 -> etc)

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
